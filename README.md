# Birdie Developer Test
Toby Drane [tobydrane@gmail.com]

## Some Thoughts
* If I had more time (currently working on dissertation) the frontend would need proper testing
* I would like to add some end to end testing
* The backend should be relatively well tested
* There could be more detail within the frontend however to create the whole project within a day I think the current spike is sufficient


Can change what recipient you want to view the information for by the dropdown. All requests should be asynchronous using redux-saga and page should present loading information whilst requests are pending.
